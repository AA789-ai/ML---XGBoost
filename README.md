# ML---XGBoost

## This is an old project that I did not get time to push on github.

#### It is there to show the understanding use of XGBoost, an ML algorithm that is very useful. 
#### We use a built-in dataset from sci-kit learn about iris color and other features. We use these features to predict the color of iris.
